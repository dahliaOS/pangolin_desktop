## About Pangolin

Pangolin is a Desktop shell for dahliaOS, written in Flutter, runs on Linux and Zircon.

Pangolin was named after a shelled animal like the [Armadillo UI](https://9to5google.com/2018/12/26/fuchsia-armadillo-ui-gone/). 

Pangolin Desktop is based on the deprecated Capybara shell, with a custom window management system built from the ground up.

You can check it online [here](https://web.dahliaos.io)!

## Important style guide

All dahliaOS applications MUST have a central theme color, that is not #ff5722, or material-deeporange or similar, as that is reserved for the system. 

Uploaders must upload a theme.txt in the root of their application, that contains the theme color, in preferably hexadecimal, but RGBA is acceptable as well. 

Uncompliant applications will have their theme colors set to a random color.
