      net.hadess.PowerProfiles:
      @short_description: Power Profiles daemon

      The power-profiles-daemon API is meant to be used by parts of the OS or
      desktop environment to switch system power profiles based on user choice,
      or user intent.

      OS components would typically use the "Profiles" property to construct
      their UI (2 or 3 profiles available), and monitor the "ActiveProfile"
      and the "PerformanceDegraded" properties to update that UI. The UI
      would try to set the "ActiveProfile" property if the user selected
      a different one.

      Note that the reason why the project exists and how it is different from
      existing projects is explained <ulink href=" https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/hadess/power-profiles-daemon/-/blob/master/README.md">
      in the project's README file</ulink>.

      The object path will be "/net/hadess/PowerProfiles".

    <!--
        HoldProfile:

        This forces the passed profile (either 'power-saver' or 'performance')
        to be activated until either the caller quits, "ReleaseProfile" is
        called, or the "ActiveProfile" is changed by the user.

        This should be used programmatically by OS components when, eg. high-
        performance workloads are started with the "performance" profile, or
        battery will soon be critically low with the "power-saver" profile.

        When conflicting profiles are requested to be held, the 'power-saver' profile
        will be activated in preference to the 'performance' profile.

        Those holds will be automatically cancelled if the user manually switches
        to another profile, and the "ProfileReleased" signal will be emitted.

    <!--
        ReleaseProfile:

        This removes the hold that was set on a profile.
    -->
    <method name="ReleaseProfile">
      <arg name="cookie" type="u" direction="in"/>
    </method>

    <!--
        ProfileReleased:

        This signal will be emitted if the profile is released because the
        "ActiveProfile" was manually changed. The signal will only be emitted
        to the process that originally called "HoldProfile".
    -->
    <signal name="ProfileReleased">
      <arg name="cookie" type="u" direction="out"/>
    </signal>

    <!--
        ActiveProfile:

        The type of the currently active profile. It might change automatically
        if a profile is held, using the "HoldProfile" function.
    -->
    <property name="ActiveProfile" type="s" access="readwrite"/>

        PerformanceInhibited:

        This property is deprecated, and unused since version 0.9.

    <property name="PerformanceInhibited" type="s" access="read"/>

    <!--
        PerformanceDegraded:

        This will be set if the performance power profile is running in degraded
        mode, with the value being used to identify the reason for that degradation.
        As new reasons can be added, it is recommended that front-ends show a generic
        reason if they do not recognise the value. Possible values are:
        - "lap-detected" (the computer is sitting on the user's lap)
        - "high-operating-temperature" (the computer is close to overheating)
        - "" (the empty string, if not performance is not degraded)

    <property name="PerformanceDegraded" type="s" access="read"/>

    <!--
        Profiles:

        An array of key-pair values representing each profile. The key named
        "Driver" (s) identifies the power-profiles-daemon backend code used to
        implement the profile.

        The key named "Profile" (s) will be one of:
        - "power-saver" (battery saving profile)
        - "balanced" (the default  profile)
        - "performance" (a profile that does not care about noise or battery consumption)

        Only one of each type of profile will be listed, with the daemon choosing the
        more appropriate "driver" for each profile type.

        This list is guaranteed to be sorted in the same order that the profiles
        are listed above.
    -->
    <property name="Profiles" type="aa{sv}" access="read"/>

    <!--
        Actions:

        An array of strings listing each one of the "actions" implemented in
        the running daemon. This is used by API users to figure out whether
        particular functionality is available in a version of the daemon.
    -->
    <property name="Actions" type="as" access="read"/>

    <!--
      ActiveProfileHolds:

      A list of dictionaries representing the current profile holds.
      The keys in the dict are "ApplicationId", "Profile" and "Reason",
      and correspond to the "application_id", "profile" and "reason" arguments
      passed to the HoldProfile() method.
